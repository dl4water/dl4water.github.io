title: Building LSTM and Transformer Models for Hydrologic Prediction
description: This tutorial provides a hands-on introduction to applying deep learning modelsâ€”LSTM and Transformerâ€”to hydrologic prediction using the CAMELS dataset. Participants will learn how to preprocess data, construct and train models, and evaluate their performance on rainfallâ€“runoff tasks. No prior hydrology experience is requiredâ€”just curiosity about deep learning for Earth science.

## ðŸ“˜ Overview

In this tutorial, we will explore how to use the **CAMELS (Catchment Attributes and Meteorology for Large-sample Studies)** dataset to build deep learning models for rainfallâ€“runoff prediction.
You will learn how to preprocess hydrologic data, construct and train **LSTM** and **Transformer** models, and evaluate their predictive performance.

To make the tutorial lightweight and runnable on Colab (even without GPU),
weâ€™ll use a **small subset (20 basins)** of CAMELS that has been pre-processed and stored as a NetCDF file.

> ðŸ’¡ *The full CAMELS dataset can be downloaded and processed using the provided [Python scripts](https://zenodo.org/records/17087240)
> (`01.download_camels.py`, `02.prepare_camels.py`), which takes about 20 minutes.*
