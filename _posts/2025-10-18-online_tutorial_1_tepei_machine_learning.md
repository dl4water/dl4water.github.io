title: Machine Learning for Natural Hazard Prediction
description: This tutorial provides a step-by-step introduction to building Landslide Susceptibility Models (LSMs) using classical machine learning algorithms. Participants will learn how to preprocess geospatial data, train ensemble models under different data partitioning and cross-validation strategies, interpret feature importance, and evaluate the spatial generalization performance of regional landslide susceptibility predictions.

#### **Overview**
This tutorial provides a hands-on introduction to **machine learning-based landslide susceptibility prediction** using **scikit-learn** in Python.  
Participants will learn how to prepare balanced datasets, select and evaluate models, and analyze the effects of **negative sample selection**, **cross-validation strategies**, and **ensemble modeling** on prediction robustness and generalization.  
All exercises are implemented in **Google Colab** for reproducibility and easy access.

#### **Key Topics**
- Fundamentals of **Landslide Susceptibility Mapping (LSM)**  
- Preparation of geomorphic and environmental features  
- **Negative sample selection:** comparing *random sampling* vs. *Positive–Unlabeled (PU) Bagging*  
- **Validation strategies:** *random* vs. *spatial cross-validation*  
- Training and evaluating ML models with **scikit-learn**: **LR, SVM, DT, RF, GBM**  
- **Ensemble modeling** and **whole-region inference** for large-scale prediction  
- **Uncertainty estimation** for model interpretability and reliability  
- Performance metrics: **Accuracy, Precision, Recall, F1, and AUC**  

---

#### **Who Should Attend**
Researchers, students, and practitioners interested in:
- Geohazard modeling and landslide risk assessment  
- Machine learning applications in geoscience and remote sensing  
- Data-driven slope stability and regional hazard prediction  

No prior experience in **engineering geology** or **machine learning** is required;  
basic familiarity with **Python and scikit-learn** is helpful but not mandatory.

#### **Learning Outcomes**
By the end of the tutorial, participants will be able to:
- Prepare balanced datasets for landslide susceptibility analysis  
- Understand importance of reliable negative samples for modeling with presence-only data  
- Compare model robustness under **random** and **spatial cross-validation**  
- Train and evaluate multiple **scikit-learn** models and ensembles for LSM  
- Perform **whole-region susceptibility inference** using ensemble outputs  
- Estimate and visualize **prediction uncertainty** to assess confidence levels  
- Interpret the physical and statistical implications of model predictions
