title: Web Application Development for Hydrologic Modeling and Visualization
description: This session introduces Tethys Platform, an open-source framework for building earth-science- focused web applications. For over a decade, scientists have used Tethys to build web applications for hydrologic modeling, visualization, and decision support. Participants will see two complementary approaches to web app development.

1. Component Apps with ReactPy: a Python-native way to build interactive, component-based web apps without writing HTML or JavaScript.
2. Low-Code Dashboards with Tethys Dash: a rapid development environment for creating analytical dashboards and visualizations with minimal coding.

By the end of the session, attendees will understand how to use Tethys to deliver hydrologic web tools ranging from lightweight dashboards to fully featured, interactive applications.
