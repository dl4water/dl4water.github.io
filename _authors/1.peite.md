Geohazards present ongoing threats to lives and infrastructure globally, with their frequency and severity exacerbated by climate change and human activities. Professor Peiâ€™s research focuses on advancing scientific understanding and improving the forecasting of climate-induced geohazards through a combination of physics-based and data-driven modeling. Pei aims to uncover the complex interactions between geohazards, human communities, and infrastructure, contributing to a deeper understanding of urban and regional dynamics, public health, and the resilience of both infrastructure and the environment.
