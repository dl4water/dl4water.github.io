title: Building LSTM and Transformer Models for Hydrologic Prediction
description: This tutorial provides a hands-on introduction to applying deep learning models—LSTM and Transformer—to hydrologic prediction using the CAMELS dataset. Participants will learn how to preprocess data, construct and train models, and evaluate their performance on rainfall–runoff tasks. No prior hydrology experience is required—just curiosity about deep learning for Earth science.

#### **Overview**
This tutorial walks participants through a complete deep learning workflow for hydrologic prediction — from raw data preparation to model training and evaluation. We use the **CAMELS dataset** and demonstrate how **LSTM** and **Transformer** architectures can model complex rainfall–runoff relationships across multiple basins. By the end of this tutorial, participants will gain both **conceptual understanding** and **hands-on experience** in building, training, and evaluating deep learning models for Earth system science.

---

#### **Key Topics**
- Overview of the CAMELS dataset and preprocessing pipeline  
- Building an **LSTM model** from scratch in under 200 lines of code  
- Data normalization and sequence sampling for time series learning  
- Model training, validation, and performance metrics (e.g., NSE)  
- Transitioning from **LSTM to Transformer** architectures  
- Discussion: strengths, limitations, and interpretability in hydrologic AI  

---

#### **Who Should Attend**
Researchers, students, and practitioners interested in:
- Hydrology and environmental modeling  
- Machine learning applications in Earth sciences  
- Data-driven approaches to water resource prediction  

No prior experience in hydrology is required; basic familiarity with **Python** and **PyTorch** is helpful but not mandatory.

#### **Learning Outcomes**
By the end of the tutorial, participants will be able to:
- Understand how to preprocess hydrologic datasets for deep learning  
- Implement and train an **LSTM-based rainfall–runoff model**  
- Extend sequence models to **attention-based Transformer architectures**  
- Evaluate model performance and interpret scientific implications
