Through our online workshop series, we host expert speakers from diverse fields who share insights on topics including LSTM and Transformer models, physics-informed deep learning, machine learning for hydrological applications, satellite imagery analysis, hydrology-agent systems, and explainable AI.

Beyond our workshops, DL4Water nurtures an open and collaborative community via Slack, bringing together researchers, students, and industry practitioners to exchange ideas, share resources, and build interdisciplinary connections.

> Alone we can do so little; together we can do so much.” — Helen Keller

Together, we strive to learn, collaborate, and innovate, leveraging AI to enhance our understanding and sustainable management of water resources.
